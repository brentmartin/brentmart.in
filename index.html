			<h1>Howdy,<br>I&rsquo;m Brent.</h1>

				<p>
				I do media and startups. I love being a dad. I <a class="scroll" href="#interests">hang my hat</a> in Austin, Tx.
				<br></br>
				Building strong relationships is my jam. Poorly-set expectations are my enemy. I have an obsession with data and analytics. I use them to measure the growth of everything from my personal life to the success of my clients.
				<br></br>
				My <a class="scroll" href="#jobs">background</a> and <a class="scroll" href="#education">education</a> is in advertising. I have <a class="scroll" href="#skills">experience</a> in both traditional and digital media. I've been on both sides of the agency, from placing media to running teams of account reps.
				<br></br>
				A need for scalable growth has led me to the <a href="https://angel.co/brentofdamartin">startup industry</a>. The high-risk/high-reward environment has kept me here. <a class="scroll" href="#results">Results</a> are the side-effect of working with passion.

  				<h3>OwnLocal</h3>
  					<h4>OnBoarding Account Representative '14-'15</h4>

  						<p>As an OnBoarding Account Rep, I learn each clients traditional process and integrate our software into it. After publication is fully onboarded, I oversee the success of their account.

  						<p><strong>I'm saving</strong> the local media industry one newspaper at a time. We create new digital revenue streams for traditional operations, train traditional sales teams on how to sell digital advertising, and arm their advertisers for the future of advertising.</p>

  						<p><strong>I'm learning</strong> there is no ceiling to how much you can grow in a company with a curious and hungry culture like the one OwnLocal fosters.</p>
            </div>
  				<h3>AD2ATX Board</h3>
  					<h4>Public Service Chair '14-'15</h4>

  						<p>As the chairman, I oversaw all of the operations of the public service committee. Our largest project involves the planning and execution of a <a href="http://ad2atx.com/public-service/">public service</a> advertising campaign for a local non profit.</p>

            <div class="jobs-expanded topic-expanded">
  						<p><strong>I gave</strong> back to the community of Austin. With Ad2ATX, I supported the growth of the local advertising industry, and as the public service chair I was able to give back to Austin's non-profit community.</p>

  						<p><strong>I learned</strong> that it is important to serve the same community that supports me.</p>

  						<p><strong>I learned</strong> that controlled growth is necessary to balance an agency. Communication from the creative team to the account team and to the clients must be be clear. Expectations must be realistic with deliverable results. Without this, an agency can implode.</p>

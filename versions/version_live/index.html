  				<h3>OwnLocal</h3>
  					<h4>OnBoarding Account Representative '14-'15</h4>
  						<p>As an Onboarding Account Rep,  I was responsible for learning each client’s process for advertising sales, assisting our team in integrating our software, and overseeing the success of the account on a long-term basis.</p>
            <div class="jobs-expanded topic-expanded">
  						<p><strong>I  helped</strong> save the media industry one newspaper at a time. We created new digital revenue streams for traditional operations, trained traditional sales teams on how to sell digital advertising, and armed their advertisers for the future in advertising</p>
  						<p><strong>I learned</strong> how to problem solve intricate client issues, work with development teams within an Agile system, and think like a software engineer.</p>
            </div>

  				<h3>AD2ATX Board</h3>
  					<h4>Public Service Chair '14-'15</h4>
  						<p>As the chairman, I oversaw all of the operations of the public service committee. Our largest project involved the planning and execution of a public service advertising campaign for a local non profit.</p>
            <div class="jobs-expanded topic-expanded">

Similarly, life outside of the classroom was wrapped entirely in a different immersive environment - Spanish.

I helped the team push through major advances in business verification, product automation, SEO reporting for customers, advanced training for sales reps, and streamlining the onboarding process.</p>
            <p><strong>The Onboarding Process &nbsp</strong> Due to rapid growth, the onboarding process became a major challenge.

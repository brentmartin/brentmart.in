			<h1>Howdy,<br>I&rsquo;m Brent.</h1>
				<p>I am a marketing strategist trained in media placement who <a class="scroll" href="#chills">chills</a> in Austin, Tx. I have a hankering for quality branding, and I am devoted to a good, clear message. I'm obsessed with numbers, consumer trends, and <a class="scroll" href="#results">results</a>.</p>
				
				<p>I have know-how in placing traditional and digital media. I am <a class="scroll" href="#skills">skilled</a> in buying on a local level, with national experience under my belt, and an understanding of multiple markets.</p>
				
				<p>After <a class="scroll" href="#working">working</a> in the industry for a couple of years, I decided to move home to Texas to finish <a class="scroll" href="#school">school</a>, and to begin small-scale consulting. I am currently in search of a career opportunity that will allow me to use and grow my marketing skills, and enable me to lay down roots.</p>
			
			<h2 id="skills">›Skills</h2>
				<h4>Tons of experience in:</h4>
					<p>Digital and traditional media strategy, client communication, media plan creation, plan presentations, target audience research, CPC/CPA analysis, social media ads, web banner ads, lead generation, CPM/CPP analysis, outdoor and billboard placement, radio placement, cable and broadcast placement, media representative relationship management,  spreadsheet creation and optimization, STRATA, Nielsen ratings</p>

					<p>Co-worker training and mentorship, brand creation, office management, content and design evaluation, web QA, HTML, pandora and spottily placement, google AdWords, satellite radio placement, mobile ads, SEO and SEM, spot production, most media buying tools and software</p>

			<h2>›Creds</h2>
				<h3 id="school">Texas State University</h3>
					<h4>BA Mass Communications, Advertising</h4>
						<p><strong>'04-'09 &nbsp</strong> Completed majority of credit hours before accepting an offer for work travel for the period of a year.</p>
						<p><strong>'12 &nbsp</strong> Finished credit hours and received degree in May.</p>

				<h3 id="working">Colling Media</h3>
					<h4>Assistant Media Buyer '10-'11</h4>
						<p>Worked in all aspects of this young and fast-growing agency, from media placement and branding, to research, sales, and management.</p>
						
						<p><strong>I brought</strong> positive results and saw growth in the advertising budgets of several large clients. I was instrumental in expanding Colling Media's vendor base to the entire state of Arizona.</p>

						<p><strong>I learned</strong> that measurable results are the key to an adaptive and growing campaign. Without a system for assessing data, understanding a market and forecasting growth can be difficult. My success at Colling Media was a direct result of implementing these systems.</p>

			
				<h3>Zenuity</h3>
					<h4>Account Executive, Account Supervisor '11-'12</h4>
						<p>Contributed to the agency's growth from ten employees to almost thirty. During that time, I managed teams while creating and implementing sales strategies.</p>

						<p><strong>I earned</strong> promotions from a Junior Account Executive, to a Senior Account Executive, then on to an Account Supervisor over a team in six months. I won several major additions to Zenuity's client base, and brought in the first international client.</p>

						<p><strong>I learned</strong> that controlled growth is necessary to balance an agency. Communication from the creative team to the account team and to the clients must be be clear. Expectations must be realistic with deliverable results. Without this, an agency can implode.</p>

				<h3>FatQuail Media (self-employed)</h3>
					<h4>Marketing Consultant '12-'13</h4>
						<p>I offer media placement services to local businesses and market consulting advice to my peers.</p>

						<p><strong>I'm gaining</strong> knowledge and creating a network of connections that will help me with FatQuail Media, and with other endeavors throughout my lifetime.</p>

						<p><strong>I'm learning</strong> about myself and the ways I can convert this knowledge into greater skills and strengths. Working by myself is challenging, and I find that it gives me a strong sense of appreciation for the skill sets of others.</p>

				<h3>I'm down with</h3>

					<p><strong>My Wife &nbsp</strong> Her pretty face. My lovebird and best pal. She has a beautiful mind, she's a gifted artist, and I'm intrigued with everything she is able to <a href="http://wayfarerscreative.com/gallery/">create</a>.</p>

					<p><strong>Austin &nbsp</strong> The creative, youthful energy that fills the city. Peaceful outdoors. Live music. Progressive attitudes. Economic growth. And the rest of the Lone Star State.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Beer &nbsp</strong> The culture of craft beer. Filling and swapping growlers of beer. Visiting breweries and brewpubs. Most importantly, sharing a well-crafted beer with friends and family.</p>

					<p><strong>Food &nbsp</strong> Food Trucks. Tacos anywhere in South Austin. BBQ and burgers. Home Slice, P. Terry's, Torchy's Tacos, and Austin Beer Garden Brewing. Locally-grown produce. Cooking from time to time with my wife. And good ol' Bluebell ice cream.</p>

					<p><strong>Sports &nbsp</strong> Watching sporting events. Analyzing player stats. Fantasy leagues. Attending any kind of live sporting event. The Houston Rockets and Texans, Arsenal F.C., and Texas State Bobcats.</p>

					<p><strong>Crafting &nbsp</strong> Just about any project where I get to use my hands. Brewing my own beer at home. Helping my wife with projects and events that she attends with <a href="http://wayfarerscreative.com/">Wayfarer's</a>. Doing basic woodworking for projects around the house.</p>

					<p><strong>Family &nbsp</strong> Our first son, <a href="http://statigr.am/tag/brooksoneverett/">Brookson Everett Martin</a>, born in November. Our amazing parents who are now grandparents. Being surrounded by uncles, aunts, and cousins who live in Austin is a blessing.</p>
					
					
				<h3>My friends would describe me as</h3>
					
					<p> Passionate about the world around me. Vigorously chasing after what I believe in. Loyal and kindhearted. Always taking care of those around me. Spirited and highly engaging. Conversations with me can be a high dose of energy. Sincerely fair. Having compassion for other people's circumstances, while striving for what is right.</p>

      <h1>Howdy,<br>I&rsquo;m Brent.</h1>

				<p>I unify teams. Top to bottom, left to right, I connect with nearly everyone.</p>
        <p>I am efficient. It can be simplified or automated, and Iâ€™m going to find a way.</p>
				<p>I know business. I think like a marketing strategist, talk to customers like an onboarding rep, encourage like a leader, and assess like a media buyer.</p>
				<p>My education is in advertising, my technical training is in Ruby on Rails. I have a wide range experience , from onboarding startup clients  to running teams of account reps.</p>
